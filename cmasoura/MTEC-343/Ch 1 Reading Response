Reading the first pages of chapter 1 of "LiveCoding: a user's manual" made me even more excited about this class. What surprised me the most was how much the live coding practice is connected to philosophical and political ideologies, and how aspects of this practice can also be understood in a symbolic manner, such as liveness and openness. I also found interesting Lialina's ideas on the relationship between the user and the computer and I now want to read her full essay on it. 
I was already familiar with the fact that live coding doesn't require a specific programming language and I knew that it is an improvisatory composition practice. I also knew the etymology of the word "programming" (cause I'm Greek).
